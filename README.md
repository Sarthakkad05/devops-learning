# DevOps Learnings 

This repository contains my hands-on DevOps assignments, experiments, and mini-projects. It covers **CI/CD, containers, orchestration, monitoring, logging, and GitOps** — everything I’ve been practicing to strengthen my DevOps skills.  

---

## Tools & Technologies  

- **Version Control** → Git, GitHub  
- **CI/CD** → GitHub Actions, ArgoCD  
- **Containers** → Docker, Docker Compose  
- **Orchestration** → Kubernetes, Helm  
- **Cloud** → AWS (ECS, ECR, basic usage)  
- **Monitoring & Logging** → Prometheus, Grafana  

---

## Key Learnings  

- Writing production-grade Dockerfiles  
- Using Docker Compose for local multi-service setups  
- Deploying to Kubernetes with manifests & Helm  
- GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD pipelines  
- GitOps workflows with ArgoCD  
- Monitoring applications with Prometheus & Grafana

## Work in Progress  

This repo is continuously evolving as I learn and build more advanced DevOps workflows.
